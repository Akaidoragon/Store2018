In this advanced learning path we take a legacy monolithic .Net application and re-architect it to use a combination of cloud services to increase scalability, performance, and manageability. With over 9 hours of practical developer focused content, this blend of instructional videos and hands on labs will empower you and your teams to begin refactoring, and modernizing legacy applications to make use of cloud microservices.  

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the principles and patterns associated with microservices
* Understand the principles and patterns associated with Restful APIs
* Understand important requirements to consider when migrating a monolithic application into a microservices architecture
* Understand the benefits of using microservices and associated software patterns and tools to build microservice based applications at speed and scale
* Understand tradeoffs between different architectural approaches 
* Become familiar and comfortable with modern open source technologies such as Dotnet Core, Docker, Docker Compose, Linux, Terraform, Swagger, and React
* Become familiar with Docker and Container orchestration runtimes to host and run containers, such as Docker Compose, Amazon ECS using Fargate, and Amazon EKS

## Prerequisites

* A basic understanding of software development
